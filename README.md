For the two new features, i already did the features functionality correctly. I already follows the clean code principles by using with descriptive name and efficient function. I also use meaningful names except i use variables "cur" to describe the variables for current data if we need to compare the new and old version of the same data in a function. For the Secure coding, i don't think we use any authentication and authorization for this assignment. For input validation i don't think there is any input validation that i need to use for this assignment also.
